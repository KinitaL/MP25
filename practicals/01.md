## REQUIREMENTS

All packages can be installed using the conda package manager - look [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) for a nice cheet-sheet! What you have to do is just create a new conda environmet and install all dependencies inside it (google the name of the package + conda). 

#### conda environiment

```
conda create --name MP25_env
conda activate MP25_env
conda install bioconda::orthofinder
conda install bioconda::iqtree
conda install bioconda::phylobayes-mpi
conda install bioconda::astral-tree
conda install bioconda::generax
conda install bioconda::trimal
conda install bioconda::AMAS
```

> Small note: As bioinformatics maybe some of you are going to develop softwares during their scientific carrier. For not-bioinformatician people (like me), installation of softwares is one of the biggest obstacles in using a specific, maybe interesting, tool. So please, try to implement the *usability* of conda.
