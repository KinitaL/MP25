### phylogenetics 101 - trees


Phylogenetic trees can be represented in multiple formats, but nonetheless they all share several interesting implications. If N = n. species, there are:


* N terminal branches
* 2N-3 total branches
* N-3 internal branches
* N-2 internal nodes


Regarding the number of trees which can possibly describe the relationships between a given number of terminal nodes (_e.g._ species),
I'll just say that is a number which goes up quite quickly. This even more true for trees with a root, as 
for each unrooted there are 2N-3 times as many rooted trees. Here are some numbers: 


| Leaves        | Unrooted trees           | Rooted trees  |
| ------------- |:------------------------:| -------------:|
| 3             | 1                        | 3             |
| 5             | 15                       | 105           |
| 7             | 945                      | 10,395        |
| 9             | 135,135                  | 2,027,025     |
| 10            | 2,027,025                | 34,459,425    |

### The Newick format:

The Newick format was developed in the 1980s and is often associated with the Newick Conference held at the [Newick restaurant](http://newicks.com/) in Dover, New Hampshire. Its simplicity made it quickly popular in the phylogenetics community, making it a de facto standard for exchanging tree data. The Newick is a combinations of parentheses, punctuation, numbers & letters. Lets take a look at some possibilities the ```.nwk``` offers:


```
(,,(,));                         	      no nodes are named

(A,B,(C,D));                     	      leaf nodes are named

(A,B,(C,D)E)F;                     	      all nodes are named

(:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5);    	      all but root node have a distance to parent

(:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5):0.0;     	      all have a distance to parent

(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);    	      distances and leaf names (popular)

(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F; 	      distances and all names

((B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)A:0.1)F; 	      a tree rooted on a leaf node (rare)
```


Last but not least, remember that ```.nwk``` trees are not unique representations, 
and that relationships between terminals can be written in several different ways.

### The Nexus format:


Originally developed in the early 1990s by researchers including Wayne Maddison and David Maddison, Nexus was created to address the need for a flexible format capable of holding various types of biological data. It can store complex datasets and the instructions needed for different analytical software. This makes it especially useful for studies that integrate multiple data types, such as molecular sequences and morphological traits. Lets take a look at its structure and syntax


Every Nexus file begins with a header line that indicates that the file follows the Nexus conventions:


```
#NEXUS
```


BNexus files are organized into one or more "blocks." Each block is a section that groups related data or commands. A block starts with the keyword ```BEGIN``` followed by the block name, and ends with ```END;```. The TAXA Block contains definitions of taxa (e.g., species or sequences).


```
  DIMENSIONS NTAX=4;
  TAXLABELS A B C D;
END;
```
CHARACTERS (or DATA) Block stores character matrices or sequence data. This block can include details about the number of characters, formatting, and missing data symbols.


```
BEGIN CHARACTERS;
  DIMENSIONS NCHAR=100;
  FORMAT DATATYPE=DNA MISSING=? GAP=-;
  MATRIX
    A ATGCT...,
    B ATG-T...
  ;
END;
```


TREES Block contains one or more phylogenetic trees. Trees can be annotated with branch lengths, support values, or other metadata.


```
BEGIN TREES;
  TREE tree1 = ((A,B),(C,D));
END;
```

We can visualize ```.nwk``` and ```.xml``` files either [online](https://itol.embl.de/upload.cgi) or using software as [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Take a look at some examples [here](https://github.com/for-giobbe/MP25/tree/main/data/example_trees) and discuss them.
