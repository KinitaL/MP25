## software installation instructions


What is needed for the practicals of this course can be subdivided into:


- packages that can be installed using [conda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conda_package_manager)
- a handfull of GUI executables

#### conda + packages


Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. Look [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf) for a nice cheet-sheet!


To intall conda follow the easy steps described [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html).


Then what you have to do is just create a new conda environiment and activate it.


```
conda create --name MP25_env #create the environiment just the first time
conda activate MP25_env # activate the environiment when doing the practicals
```

Then it is possible to install packages inside it. You can try to google the name of the package + conda, but generally the syntax is ```conda install channel::package```. Here are (most) of the packages you will need!


```
conda install bioconda::orthofinder
conda install bioconda::iqtree
conda install bioconda::phylobayes-mpi
conda install bioconda::astral-tree
conda install bioconda::generax
conda install bioconda::trimal
conda install bioconda::AMAS
```

When you want to get outside the environiment use ```conda deactivate``` and subsequently to reactivate it ```conda activate MP25_env```.

If you are a Windows PC user I highly recommend installing WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). This way, you can work in a Linux environment directly from your Windows PC without the need for a virtual machine. Open the PowerShell and type ```wsl --install```. This command will install WSL with the default Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu). 
After installation, restart your computer if required and open WSL by running```wsl``` which will launch your Linux terminal, where you can proceed with setting up Anaconda and other tools.

#### executables


Here are all the GUI software we will use:

* [Aliview](https://github.com/AliView/AliView) - to visualize multiple sequence alignement
* [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) - to visualize phylogenies
* [tracer](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) - to explore statistics of Bayesian Inferences
* [Rstudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - to perform some (phylogenetic) data analysis and plotting

Now that you mastered a package management system, you moght want to learn about version control using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [github](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world). While it is not strictly necessary for the course, it is fundamental!

**If you get stuck feel free to reach for help via e-mail.**


> Small note: As bioinformatics maybe some of you are going to develop softwares during their scientific carrier. For not-bioinformatician people (like me), installation of softwares is one of the biggest obstacles in using a specific, maybe interesting, tool. So please, try to implement the *usability* of conda.
