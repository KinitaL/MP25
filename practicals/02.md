## phylogenetics 101 - trees

the newick format:

If you open the tree.nwk, you will see a curious set of parentheses and commas .... the Newick is by far the most used format to store trees and it substantially is a combinations of parentheses, punctuation, numbers & letters. The format name is known to have a quite funny origin. Lets take a look at some possibilities the .nwk offers:

(,,(,));                         	      no nodes are named

(A,B,(C,D));                     	      leaf nodes are named

(A,B,(C,D)E)F;                     	      all nodes are named

(:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5);    	      all but root node have a distance to parent

(:0.1,:0.2,(:0.3,:0.4):0.5):0.0;     	  all have a distance to parent

(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4):0.5);    	  distances and leaf names (popular)

(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F; 	      distances and all names

((B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)A:0.1)F; 	  a tree rooted on a leaf node (rare)

Such a simple format has several interesting implications. If N = n. species, there are:

N terminal branches
2N-3 total branches
N-3 internal branches
N-2 internal nodes

Regarding the number of trees which can possibly describe the relationships between a given number of terminal nodes (e.g. species), I'll just say that is a number which goes up quite quickly. This even more true for trees with a root, as for each unrooted there are 2N-3 times as many rooted trees. Here are some numbers:

Leaves	Unrooted trees	Rooted trees
3	1	3
5	15	105
7	945	10,395
9	135,135	2,027,025
10	2,027,025	34,459,425


Last but not least, remember that .nwk trees are not unique representations, and that relationships between terminals can be written in several different ways.

We can visualize .nwk files either using GUI software as FigTree or packages like ggtree in R.
