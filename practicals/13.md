# concatenation-based versus coalescence-based inferences

 For this purpose, IQ-TREE implements the Robinson-Foulds distances calculation, a metric able to compare topologies between **binary** but **unrooted** trees (see [here](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~hadas/mitcompbio/treedistance.html) for an in-depth explanation on computational methods). In brief it measures the symmetric difference between two trees by adding the number of splits (*i.e* edges) that are present in tree A (but not tree B) to the number of splits present in tree B (but not tree A).
